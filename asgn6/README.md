### Extra Credit

######Validation and Error Messages attempted
Error message shows up if required fields are missing but the rest of the page does not properly load. 
When attempting to redirect back to the same page, I would constantly get a 'express deprecated' message; when I used res.render instead, the previously logged images wouldn't display.
